# Enhanced Cooldown Manager by Argium

Enhanced Cooldown Manager creates a clean combat HUD around Blizzard's built-in cooldown manager that **looks and works great out of the box** and is **straightforward to customise.**

Made with ❤️, with little features you didn't know you needed and won't want to live without.

##  Features

### ⚔️ Inline Resources

Adds essential combat bars directly below Blizzard's cooldown manager.

- `Power Bar` for mana, rage, energy, focus, and runic power
- `Resource Bar` for class resources
- `Rune Bar` for Death Knight rune tracking
- `Aura Bars` with unified style and color control

### 🎨 Aura Bars

Automatically position aura bars and style them to match. Change their colors for different spells so you can see their remaining duration at a glance.

### 🙈 Smart Visibility and Fade Rules

Reduce screen clutter automatically based on gameplay context:

- Hide while mounted or in a vehicle
- Hide in rest areas
- Fade when out of combat
- Optionally stay visible in instances (raids, M+, PVP)
- Optionally stay visible when you have an attackable target

### 🟥 Death Knight Runes

Track each rune independently as it recharges inline with other resources and cooldowns.
