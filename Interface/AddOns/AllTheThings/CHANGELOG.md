# AllTheThings

## [5.0.11](https://github.com/ATTWoWAddon/AllTheThings/tree/5.0.11) (2026-02-18)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/ATTWoWAddon/AllTheThings/compare/5.0.10...5.0.11) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/ATTWoWAddon/AllTheThings/releases)

- parseing  
- mountDB work

- [Logic] Minilist: Rares mapped in from other Locations will now use the root Rares header of the Minilist to organize themselves  
    * [Note: Found it very annoying personally to be looking for Rares in DF where there are many different nested sections for Rares active in a given Zone, when it is far simpler to just look in one section to see all the "possible creatures that could be up" and leave the existing organization below that]
