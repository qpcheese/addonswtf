Added indication for warband-wide tints signified by a blue outline and tooltip line.

Added list of characters who earned the specific tint of an artifact weapon when holding shift over a tint

Added a checkbox and menu setting frame to display all artifact weapons in the dropdown menu

Modified how the default frame scaled with the user's screen size to potentially fit on the screen better

Fix error in Windwalker hidden artifact not displayed as unlocked after being obtained (was set to the Elemental shaman hidden artifact ID)

# 0.0.8

# 0.0.7

Undo the hidden artifacts being unobtainable as per November 14, 2025 hotfixes

# 0.0.6

Removed 3rd row 3rd tint's obtainable status (+5 keystone complete) - the achievements required to unlock these are not obtainable in remix.

# 0.0.5

Removed hidden artifact obtainable status - Despite Blizzard's bluepost once saying these were going to be obtainable, these are not in fact currently obtainable in remix.

# 0.0.4

quick fix to false desaturated transmog icon on unobtainable tints (oops)

properly re-instated these glorious manual changelogs instead of the auto-generated ones

Potentially fixed the item name not displaying upon first opening of panel


# 0.0.3

Added functionality to track hidden artifact appearances in the swatch tint color tooltip (ie 30 dungeons, 200 world quests, 1000 enemy player kills)

A desaturated transmog icon will appear on tints which are collected but the transmog is not learned. This will indicate a tooltip that states a relog is required for it to take effect (learn the transmog)

# 0.0.2

Added in a tab to the Remix Artifact Frame UI to access the appearances

Fixed rogues having debug settings by accident (you can not in fact access 36 artifacts as a rogue, try as you might to steal them all)

Added a special Evoker artifact :^)
